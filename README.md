## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

index.html: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the game.
style.css: This file contains all the styles used in the game.
script.js: This is where the game logic is implemented.

## How to Play

Open the index.html file in your browser.
You'll see a screen with a field to input your guess, a "Check!" button to submit your guess, and a "Again!" button to restart the game.
The game starts with a score of 20. Each wrong guess decreases your score by 1.
The game also keeps track of your high score across multiple rounds.


## Game Rules

The game generates a secret number between 1 and 20.
If your guess is too high or too low, the game will give you a hint.
If your guess is correct, the background color changes to green and you'll see a message saying "Yay You got it."
Each wrong guess decreases your score by 1.
The game ends when your score reaches 0 or you guess the correct number.
